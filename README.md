FlyPaper
===
*Remember, life is only chaos for the fly*

`matrix-fly-paper` is a [Matrix](https://matrix.org) bot based on [turt2live/matrix-js-bot-sdk](https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-js-bot-sdk.git) to help automate basic community moderation for server and room admins. Because it uses the Client-Server API, it is not necessary to run the bot on the homeserver itself and can be used by anyone who can grant room moderator privileges to the bot user.

## Installation & Usage
---
v1.0.0 has not been reached. `matrix-fly-paper` is not recommended for use in production and has not been published to npm yet.

## Features
---
### TODO
- [ ] Automatically apply `m.room.server_acl` events to all rooms the bot is a member of
- [ ] Automatically give a warning, kick, and/or ban to room members who violate a list of configurable regex
- [ ] Access the server admin API through DMs

## License
---
All original code is licensed under the [Non-Violent Public License v1+](https://git.pixie.town/thufie/NPL). Obviously, community moderation is a form of private censorship, and legal constructs such as freedom of speech and freedom of association do not apply to private communities and organizations in most countries. However, it is clear that this tool can be abused by bad actors; the NPLv1+ explicitly and legally forbides the use of this code to suppress non-violent actors operating in good faith.
